# Project-Sentiment-analysis-on-blog-posts-using-NLP

## We built a text classification model using the Naive Bayes algorithm to categorize the blog posts accurately. Furthermore, performed sentiment analysis to understand the general sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) expressed in these posts.
